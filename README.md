# UI elements
A basic implementation of various ui elements using python and pygame

For now the only ui elements i have implemented are the label and the button
However i'll be coming back to this project and add a bunch of ui elements in the future, like :

1. Radiobutton
2.Entry box
3. Color picker
4. popup message box
5. breadcrumbs
6. menu
7. menubutton
8. file selector
9. check button
10. progress bar
